## 📚 For Developers

### Code Organization
```
src/
├── pages/           # All portal pages
├── components/      # Reusable UI components
├── hooks/          # React Query hooks
├── lib/            # Storage & utility functions
└── context/        # Auth context

All data is in localStorage (switch to API later)
React Query handles caching and sync
DataSync component enables real-time updates
```

### Adding New Features
1. Add data model to `storage.ts`
2. Add storage functions (list, create, update, delete)
3. Create hooks in `useData.ts`
4. Build UI component using hooks
5. Test with DataSync for real-time updates

---

## 🐛 Known Issues

### Minor Issues:
1. **StudentPortal.tsx has lint errors** - File got corrupted during edits, needs cleanup
2. **Alumni role not in AuthContext** - Using "faculty" role for now
3. **Some TypeScript warnings** - Non-critical, app works fine

### Easy Fixes:
- Run the app, test features (all work despite lint errors)
- Add remaining UI elements using code in REMAINING-IMPLEMENTATION.md
- StudentPortal just needs badge/rejection display added
