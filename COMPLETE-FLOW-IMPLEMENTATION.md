## 📝 Notes for Developer

### Data is Ready ✅
All backend storage functions exist. You just need to create UI components that call these functions.

### Hooks Pattern
Follow existing pattern in `useData.ts`:
```typescript
export function useStudentProfile(userName: string) {
  return useQuery({
    queryKey: ["profile", userName],
    queryFn: () => getStudentProfile(userName)
  });
}
```

### Real-time Updates
All new features will auto-sync via `DataSync` component already mounted in `App.tsx`.

### Testing Flow
1. Start dev: `npm run dev`
2. Login as different roles
3. Test cross-portal updates (e.g., Industry rejects → Student sees reason)
4. Check notifications tray for alerts
